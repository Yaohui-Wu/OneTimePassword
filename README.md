* A one-time password algorithm based on the "JunTai"(Shuffle) distribution random number algorithm.
* The so-called "JunTai"(Shuffle) distribution random number algorithm refers to: each number (integer or real number) is distributed disorderly on the number axis, the value appears only once and never repeats.
* "Jun"(Average) is reflectedin the value of each number is the average probability, that is, there is a occurrence; the "Tai"(State) is reflected in the uniqueness of the position of each number on the number axis.
* The "JunTai"(Shuffle) distribution random number algorithm is divided into the true "JunTai"(Shuffle) distribution random number algorithm and the pseudo "JunTai"(Shuffle) distribution random number algorithm.
* True "JunTai"(Shuffle) distribution random number algorithm is close to the natural random number algorithm, which is difficult to crack. Because the number axis is infinite, there can not be repeated values at all, that is, it can not be cycled.
* The values of the pseudo "JunTai"(Shuffle) distribution random number algorithm have a range and will be cracked. Because the values are repeated, that is, there is a loop.
* This program algorithm is based on the pseudo "JunTai"(Shuffle) distribution random number algorithm, which can be used not only for SSH as an login password, but also can be used as the key of encryption and decryption algorithm.
